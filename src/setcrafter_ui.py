    Welcome to SetCrafter AI! This tool assists DJs in organizing and curating their music libraries with the help of AI.
    Below are the steps to categorize and curate your tracks:

    1. **Categorize Tracks**: Upload your music library or enter the path to your library to let AI categorize your tracks.
    2. **Curate Set**: After categorization, you can create a curated set from your categorized tracks.

    For more detailed instructions and information on how to use this tool, please refer to the [User Guide](#).
