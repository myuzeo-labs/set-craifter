# SetCrafter AI

## Introduction

SetCrafter AI is a project designed to revolutionize the way DJs organize and curate their music libraries. Utilizing AI-driven categorization and Spotify's API, SetCrafter AI automates the sorting of large and unorganized DJ libraries into cohesive sets.

## Features

- **Automated Categorization:** Sorts tracks into seven different categories based on their fit within an hour-long set, using 10-minute increments.
- **AI-Driven Classification:** Employs machine learning techniques to classify tracks with reasonable accuracy.
- **Spotify API Integration:** Enriches track metadata with additional data such as energy, acoustics, and danceability.
- **Set Curation:** Curates sets based on categorized tracks, considering factors like BPM, key, and energy levels.
